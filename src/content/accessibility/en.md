The Center for Direct Scientific Communication (CCSD) is committed to making its websites accessible in accordance with
Article 47 of the French Law No. 2005-102 of February 11, 2005.

To this end, an “Accessibility” working group has been created to draft the multi-year accessibility plan.

This accessibility statement applies to the present website.

## Compliance Status

This website is not compliant with the General Accessibility Improvement Framework, RGAA version 4.1, due to
the absence of an accessibility audit.

## Establishment of This Accessibility Statement

This statement was established on October 28, 2025.

## Feedback and Contact

It is important to recall that, under Article 11 of the February 2005 law: “Persons with disabilities are entitled to
compensation for the consequences of their disability, regardless of the origin and nature of their impairment, their
age, or their lifestyle.”

The CCSD is committed to taking the necessary measures to provide access, within a reasonable timeframe, to the
information and functionalities sought by persons with disabilities, whether or not the content is subject to an
exemption.

The CCSD invites anyone experiencing difficulties to contact us at accessibilite@ccsd.cnrs.fr so that assistance can
